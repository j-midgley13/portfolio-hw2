# portfolio-hw2

Introduction
-------------
This is my initial commit for my homework 2, creating a portfolio for myself using Bootstrap elements.

Objective
--------------
My objective in this is to creat a deployed website portfolio that is mobile responsive.
I need to have a consistent navbar with links to Home, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
I must have valid and correct HTML pages with semantic tags. Must have my personalized information.
Lastly, complete this portfolio using bootstrap components and the grid system.
